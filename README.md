## Description

This is a Python-based application designed to help users improve their code typing speed and accuracy directly from the terminal. The main goal of the project is to provide a convenient and efficient way for developers to enhance their typing dexterity, which is a crucial skill.

The main logic of the application is contained within the `main.py` file. It includes functions for generating typing tests, calculating words per minute (WPM) and accuracy, and updating a leaderboard with the user's performance.

The `leaderboard.json` file is used to store the leaderboard data. This file contains the usernames of users along with their best WPM and accuracy scores. The `words.json` file contains a list of words that are used to generate the typing tests.

The `test_main.py` file contains unit tests for the functions in `main.py`. These tests help ensure that the application's logic is working as expected and make it easier to catch and fix bugs.
